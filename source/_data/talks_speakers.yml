        talk_description: "What if you can use the fastest JavaScript framework along with React? What if you can build applications that feel fast regardless of application size? <br />

Qwik is a JavaScript framework that uses a new rendering paradigm called resumability. It can serialize a JavaScript app into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique used in meta-frameworks like Next.js.
<br />
In this talk, Ruby Jane Cabagnot will talk about Qwik and reusability. Then talk about QwikReact, which allows you to use React components in Qwik, including the whole ecosystem of component libraries, such as Material UI, Threejs, and React Spring.
<br />
 Is Qwik the world's first O(1) JavaScript framework? Let's find out."

        talk_title: "How to train your useReducer: turning your state management strategy into a Night Fury"
        talk_description: "Splitting the view from the controller is foundational to build great applications. <br />
        We tend to rely on external libraries to manage their state. But React itself has a great off-the-shelf state management tool: the useReducer.
In this talk we’re going to get to know more about it, and especially learn how to enhance it tailoring it to our needs. <br />
You'll discover what you have been missing."

        talk_description: "Over the last 25 years we have seen many products and services designed to edit websites in a visual way. <br />
        They were either good for developers or for content editors: never for both.<br />
        We built React Bricks to overcome this limitation with a good abstraction that unifies the team and streamlines the process. <br />
        We’ll explore the technical challenges we faced, the solutions we found and we’ll see how fun it is to develop visually editable Lego bricks of content using just React components."

        talk_title: "Do not break GraphQL, extend it!"
        talk_description: "GraphQL is powerful technology to retrieve and send complex structures from remote locations with a simple and effective syntax. One of its perks is avoid under-fetching and over-fetching as the client specifically requests the fields it’s interested in.
<br />
But what happens if we need to enrich or customize the data set and we can’t modify the upstream GraphQL server? Shall we break the spec?
<br />
In this talk I will show you how to use the resources the GraphQL specification already gives us to solve this issue without having to break the rules."
