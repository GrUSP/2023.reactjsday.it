        We tend to rely on external libraries to manage their state. But React itself has a great off-the-shelf state management tool: the useReducer.

        Not only have the new docs changed how people learn React, they’ve inspired how we think about developer education as a community. <br />
        In this talk, you will learn how the React team and some ambitious community members made the “React docs rock” for a generation of front end developers and how these new patterns and established techniques can be applied in your favorite projects."

        We built React Bricks to overcome this limitation with a good abstraction that unifies the team and streamlines the process. <br />
        We’ll explore the technical challenges we faced, the solutions we found and we’ll see how fun it is to develop visually editable Lego bricks of content using just React components."

        talk_description: "What if you can use the fastest JavaScript framework along with React? What if you can build applications that feel fast regardless of application size? <br />
        Qwik is a JavaScript framework that uses a new rendering paradigm called resumability. It can serialize a JavaScript app into HTML, thus eliminating the need for the hydration technique used in meta-frameworks like Next.js.
        <br />
        In this talk, Ruby Jane Cabagnot will talk about Qwik and reusability. Then talk about QwikReact, which allows you to use React components in Qwik, including the whole ecosystem of component libraries, such as Material UI, Threejs, and React Spring.
        <br />
        Is Qwik the world's first O(1) JavaScript framework? Let's find out."

By building the same application using React and other popular JavaScript frameworks, we'll conduct a comparative analysis. Join me as we dissect React's approach to these core concepts and evaluate how it stacks up against other frameworks.

        talk_description: "GraphQL is powerful technology to retrieve and send complex structures from remote locations with a simple and effective syntax. One of its perks is avoid under-fetching and over-fetching as the client specifically requests the fields it’s interested in.
        <br />
        But what happens if we need to enrich or customize the data set and we can’t modify the upstream GraphQL server? Shall we break the spec?
        <br />
        In this talk I will show you how to use the resources the GraphQL specification already gives us to solve this issue without having to break the rules."
